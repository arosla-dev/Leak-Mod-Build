thank you for installing beta version of mod

what is this mod anyway?
Just adding sandbox elements to the old and familiar Half-Life 2 beta

a couple of questions that may appear:
q - question
a - answer
------------------

Q - How to run this thing?

A - just run HL2.exe

Q - why is the mod unstable?

A - the mod is still being developed on an unstable version of the engine, so you can find a lot of bugs in the game

Q - will there be multiplayer support?
A - no, it won't

Q - my worldcraft / hammer crashes as soon as I try to open/create a map!

A - the thing is that hammer is not supported, and compiling it for this version of the game is quite difficult

A - will there be lua support?

Q - maybe in the future, but I don't guarantee it
